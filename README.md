# Saida-s-homework
Hi, there!
This little portfolio shows some of my exercises for the Web confection and publishing course I'm taking.
Every single line of code has been written by me, except for the libraries, of course. 
Note that those are part of my learning process and have defined purposes, like understanding the use of the canvas, or the creation of an array and its visualization on the web page, etc. 
Some of them look rough (the canvas ones, for example), and some look more polished (I'm almost proud of the process of Monasterio), but their only purpose is to acknowledge the bases of HTML, CSS, JS, the libraries, responsive design and accessibility.
Thanks a lot for your time ;)
